        <h2>History of covid 19</h2>
        <p>Coronaviruses are a big family of different viruses. Some of them cause the common cold in people. Others infect animals, including bats, camels, and cattle. But how did SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, come into being?
            Here’s what we know about the virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has set off a global pandemic.

        <h2>Where Did the Coronavirus Come From?</h2>
        <!--pharagraphs-->
        <p>Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. That’s also how the coronaviruses behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) got started.
            SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan’s open-air “wet markets.” They’re where customers buy fresh meat and fish, including animals that are killed on the spot.
            Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs. Crowded conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can start to infect and spread among people.
            Still, the Wuhan market didn’t sell bats at the time of the outbreak. That’s why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which are sold illegally in some markets in China. Some coronaviruses that infect pangolins are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
            As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct contact with animals. That meant the virus is transmitted from one human to another. It’s now spreading in the U.S. and around the globe, meaning that people are unwittingly catching and passing on the coronavirus. This growing worldwide transmission is what is now a pandemic.

        <h2>Coronavirus Evolution</h2>
  <!--pharagraphs-->
        <p>
            Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in 1965. It caused a common cold. Later that decade, researchers found a group of similar human and animal viruses and named them after their crown-like appearance.
            Seven coronaviruses can infect humans. The one that causes SARS emerged in southern China in 2002 and quickly spread to 28 other countries. More than 8,000 people were infected by July 2003, and 774 died. A small outbreak in 2004 involved only four more cases. This coronavirus causes fever, headache, and respiratory problems such as cough and shortness of breath.
            MERS started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Almost all of the nearly 2,500 cases have been in people who live in or travel to the Middle East. This coronavirus is less contagious than its SARS cousin but more deadly, killing 858 people. It has the same respiratory symptoms but can also cause kidney failure.

        <h2>How covid 19 start in Sri Lanka</h2>
  <!--pharagraphs-->
        <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ... The first confirmed case of the virus was reported in Sri Lanka on 27 January 2020, a 44-year-old Chinese tourist from Hubei Province.

                <h3>RNA vaccines</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Diagram of the operation of an RNA vaccine. Messenger RNA contained in the vaccine enters cells and is translated into foreign proteins, which trigger an immune response.<br>An RNA vaccine contains RNA which, when introduced into a tissue, acts as messenger RNA (mRNA) to cause the cells to build the foreign protein and stimulate an adaptive immune response which teaches the body how to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells. RNA vaccines often, but not always, use nucleoside-modified messenger RNA. The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.<br>RNA vaccines were the first COVID-19 vaccines to be authorized in the United States and the European Union. As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. As of February 2021, the CVnCoV RNA vaccine from CureVac is awaiting authorization in the EU.<br>Severe allergic reactions are rare. In December 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine administration resulted in 175 cases of severe allergic reaction, of which 21 were anaphylaxis.For 4,041,396 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose administrations in December 2020 and January 2021, only 10 cases of anaphylaxis were reported.[103] The lipid nanoparticles were most likely responsible for the allergic reactions.</p>

                <h3>Adenovirus vector vaccines</h3>
            </div>

        <p>These vaccines are examples of non-replicating viral vector vaccines, using an adenovirus shell containing DNA that encodes a SARS‑CoV‑2 protein.[104][105] The viral vector-based vaccines against COVID-19 are non-replicating, meaning that they do not make new virus particles, but rather produce only the antigen which elicits a systemic immune response.<br>As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine,the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, Convidecia, and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.<br>Convidecia and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine are both one-shot vaccines which offer less complicated logistics and can be stored under ordinary refrigeration for several months.<br>The Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine uses Ad26 for the first dose, which is the same as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine's only dose, and Ad5 for the second dose. Convidecia uses Ad5 for its only dose.</p>

        <div class="vac">
            <h3>Inactivated virus vaccines</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Inactivated vaccines consist of virus particles that have been grown in culture and then are killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde to lose disease producing capacity, while still stimulating an immune response.<br>As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Chinese CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV,and WIBP-CorV; the Indian Covaxin; and the Russian CoviVac.Vaccines in clinical trials include the Valneva COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

        <div class="vac">
            <h3>Subunit vaccines</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Subunit vaccines present one or more antigens without introducing whole pathogen particles. The antigens involved are often protein subunits, but can be any molecule that is a fragment of the pathogen.<br>As of April 2021, the two authorized vaccines of this type are the peptide vaccine EpiVacCorona and RBD-Dimer.[3] Vaccines with pending authorizations include the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, SOBERANA 02 (a conjugate vaccine), and the Sanofi–GSK vaccine. The V451 vaccine was previously in clinical trials, which were terminated because it was found that the vaccine may potentially cause incorrect results for subsequent HIV testing.</p>

        <div class="vac">
            <h3>Other Types</h3>
        </div>
        
        <p>Additional types of vaccines that are in clinical trials include virus-like particle vaccines, multiple DNA plasmid vaccines,at least two lentivirus vector vaccines,[134][135] a conjugate vaccine, and a vesicular stomatitis virus displaying the SARS‑CoV‑2 spike protein.<br>Oral vaccines and intranasal vaccines are being developed and studied.<br>Scientists investigated whether existing vaccines for unrelated conditions could prime the immune system and lessen the severity of COVID‑19 infection. There is experimental evidence that the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis has non-specific effects on the immune system, but no evidence that this vaccine is effective against COVID‑19.</p>
